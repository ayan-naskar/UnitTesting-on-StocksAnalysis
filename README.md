**Few Points to NOTE:**
1. Unit testing is done till "breather_filter()"
2. "ITC.NS_historical_data.csv" file is also used as a part of Test case
3. Not all the functions have their unique py file to test them.
4. Some of the tests are skipped because they were very basic or can be ignored, but must be unskipped in the final submission
5. Some tests has some of their test-cases statemented, they also need to be unmarked

**Files Description:**
1. Files starting with test_*.py are for testing.
2. Files under Projcode, are basically code, copied from Main Stock_Analysis jupyter file
3. "TestCase/TestCaseGen.py" was written to make synthetic data for test-cases, but, was not used in any way and can be ignored.

**To run the unit testing:**
1. Make sure the contents folder is properly setup
2. Run the "Unit_Test.py" file to begin testing
